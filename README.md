The Salary Cap Builder is an innovative tool designed to help users create and manage team rosters while considering salary cap constraints. Currently in its early development stage, the application allows users to add and modify players within NFL rosters, with future plans to extend support to other leagues. Although the cap hit calculations are simulated at this stage, the app provides a realistic environment for exploring various roster configurations and their financial implications.

Features:

Create NFL team rosters
Add and remove players while tracking salary cap impacts
Simulated cap hit calculations for realistic planning
Future plans to include other major sports leagues
